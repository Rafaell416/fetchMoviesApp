# FetchMovies App

I usually use expo to build react native apps, but by this time i wanted to test 
using a plain react native project to feel myself not too limited with some features
and get a production ready app

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to use [movies api](https://moviesapiexample.com) and fetch movies
then you'll be able to view trailers of videos about the movie

## Installation and Run

To run the project locally you can run the following commands on your terminal

```
git clone git@github.com:Rafaell416/fetchMoviesApp.git
cd fetchMoviesApp
yarn install
yarn i or yarn a to run on ios or android emulator respectively
```

### Stack

The stack used in this app
```
nodejs : v8.11.2
react-native-cli: 2.0.1
react-native: 0.56.0

```
